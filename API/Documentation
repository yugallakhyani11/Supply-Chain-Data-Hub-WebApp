Overview:
This API provides endpoints to retrieve information about companies and their locations. It uses FastAPI as the web framework and reads data from CSV files.
Key Components:

Models: Define the structure of our data (Company, Location) and responses (ResponseModel).
Services: Contain the business logic for retrieving and processing data.
Controllers: Define the API endpoints and handle request/response flow.
Utilities: Provide helper functions, such as CSV file reading.
Exception Handling: Custom exceptions for specific error scenarios.


Main Features:

Retrieve all companies
Retrieve a specific company by ID
Retrieve all locations for a specific company


Data Flow:
a. Client makes a request to an endpoint.
b. Controller receives the request and calls the appropriate service method.
c. Service method reads data from CSV files using utility functions.
d. Service processes the data and returns a ResponseModel.
e. Controller returns the ResponseModel to the client.
Error Handling:

Custom exceptions (NotFoundException, BadRequestException) are used for specific error scenarios.
Exceptions are caught in controllers and converted to appropriate HTTP responses.
Logging is implemented for better debugging and monitoring.


Response Structure:
All API responses use a consistent ResponseModel structure:

success: Boolean indicating if the operation was successful.
message: A descriptive message about the operation result.
data: The actual data returned (type varies based on the endpoint).


Future Improvements:

Implement database integration for more efficient data storage and retrieval.
Add authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Implement caching to improve performance for frequently accessed data.



This API provides a solid foundation for managing company and location data, with a clear structure and consistent error handling. It can be easily extended to include additional features or integrate with other systems as needed.
